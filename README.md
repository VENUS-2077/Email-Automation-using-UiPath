# Email Automation using UiPath

This project automates the process of retrieving unread emails from Outlook, preprocessing their content, performing sentiment analysis using a Python script, and sending the analyzed results back via email. The workflow is built using UiPath.

## Overview

This UiPath project is designed to automate email processing tasks, specifically:

1. Retrieve unread emails from a specific folder in Outlook.
2. Extract relevant details such as sender name, email address, subject, date and time, and body content.
3. Preprocess the email text by cleaning and formatting it for sentiment analysis.
4. Run sentiment analysis using an external Python script.
5. Save the processed data and analysis results to a text file.
6. Send the analysis results back to the user via email.
